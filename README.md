To use **Github**, one must download **GIT** on their local machine and create a **respository** using the **remote**. Once you've made your Github repository, you can create a **branch**. The main branch represents all of the up-to-date work on a project, while other branches can represent features still in-progress. The version of the project on your local machine is called a **clone**. You can **pull** the contents of the main branch (or any other branch) to your local machine with the command of the same name. You can also **push** content to the repository, but to do so you must **commit** files that you changed, then **merge** them with the existing versions of those files. If there is a conflict with your files and the ones in the main branch, this will create a **merge conflict**. Merge conflcits are infuriating to fix. Good luck. Lastly, you can grab features from other repositories alltogether with the **fetch** command.

**Branch** -- An iteration of work or a division of code that may or may not have been sent to the main project.

**Clone** -- Copy of the local gitHub repository on a local machine.

**Commit** -- Dedicating a collection of files to be sent from the local machine to gitHub.

**Fetch** -- Download files from another repository.

**GIT** -- The program on the local machine that communicates with Github.

**Github** -- The website that stores a project.

**Merge** -- Overwrite changes/combine data from local clone up to Github.

**Merge Conflict** -- When a merge isn't possible due to conflicting data.

**Push** -- The process of moving changed files from the local machine to the main branch.

**Pull** -- The process of grabbing changed files from the main branch to your local machine.

**Remote** -- Allows you to create, view, and delete connections to other repositories.

**Repository** -- A project on github.
